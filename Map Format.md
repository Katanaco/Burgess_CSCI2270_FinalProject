<h1> Creating a Map File for expGame </h1>
1. Draw your map on a 12 by 8 grid (like the one below) with ids and your connections labeled 
2. Put some line at the top of the file for your use, expGame skips the first line in map files
3. Label lines 1-96 with id #'s 0-95
4. List all ids a certain id is connceted to as a comma separated list (Note: the last entry must have a comma after it)
5. Id's must be connected both ways, if 36 connects to 35 then 35 must also connect to 36
